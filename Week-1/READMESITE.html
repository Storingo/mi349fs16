        <p> Hello, this is my fourth year at MSU. I spent the first three as a Computer Science major.
        I swicthed to Media and Information last year during the spring semester. Thankfully I did finish enough CSE 
        classes so that I completed the requirements for the CSE minor.</p>
        
        p {
            font-family: serif;
            font-size: 20px;
            text-align: center;
        }
        <p> My hobbies are mainly video games and watching anime. I also like many other types of game like board games and card games.
        I would have to say my favorite games are proably Borderlands, Deadspace, and Darksousls.</p>
        
        p{
            font-family: "Times New Roman";
            font-size: 20px;
            text-align: center;
        }
        <p> I'm taking this class becaseu I'm interested in web design. I have no previous experince with web design.
        The only programming experience i have is with C, C++, and some Python. I had no idea how to use CSS so I
        had to look up a few basics to do this and use the template provided. I hope this is formated corectly and that this 
        gave a little insight to my experince level and who I am.</p>
