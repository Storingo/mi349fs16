              <h3 class="title">Pokemon Sun & Moon Review</h3>
              <h5 class="author">Dylan Storing-O'Dowd    12/06/2016</h5>
            </header>
            <p>Sun & Moon are a fresh change of pace for the searies. The new challenege system that replaces the gyms is somthing new to experience.
              The setting is nice, the islands are a good way of splitting up the game. The players think they know how far they are in the game based on
              how many islands they've vistied, but this isnt exactly true since different islands have different amounts of content. Some might think that
              the reagon might be lacking diversity in environments, but this is far from the truth. Every type of environment can be seen from chilling snow
              areas to blistering deserts.</p>

              <p> Finally the new pokemon. There is a very good variety of new pokemon. Most the designs are fantastic with a few less than exciting designs.
                This is to be expected though every generation of pokemon has a few duds. The real world creatures and legends that the pokemon are made of are
                fantastic and feel like they really fit the region. The new Alola forms are hit or miss. Some are fantastic, some are bad, and some just make you
                say "What?" All in All, I found this new pokemon generation to be fun and inviting and look forward to playing it much more.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Top 5 Recent Tactical RPGs</h3>
              <h5 class="author">Dylan Storing-O'Dowd   11/30/2016</h5>
            </header>
            <p> For this list I'm considering "recent" within the past 5 years. For those that are unfamilier with this genre of game. Tactical RPGs are role-playing
              games that have a more indepth battle system. These systems usually include some form of battle field that the characters have to move aorund in to attack.
              The games are usually tunr based or the player can pause and resume time to give orders to the characters giving the games a tactical aspect. Now to the list,
              these games are not in a specific order.</p>
            <h6 class="top5">5: XCOM: Enemy Unknown</h6>
            <p>In XCOM: enemy unknown you play as the commander of the XCOM unit. XCOM is created to defeat the aliens that are attacking Earth. There are two distinct areas of play.
              First is when you're in the base. Here the player preps for area two. They will creat new rooms to get resources, develop new technology, deal with different countries and mcuh more.
              In area two the player will deploy a team of operatives to combat the aliens. They start with a team of four but can go up to six. The game is very difficult especially in the harder settings.
              This can be seen in XCOM 2 as the canon ending is that XCOM loses to the aliens.</p>
            <h6 class="top5">4: Wasteland 2</h6>
            <p>Wasteland 2 is the sequel to wasteland one of the ealry rpgs on the pc and the game that brought us the Fallout series. In Game you play as team of four trying to become desert rangers in a post apocalyptic world.
               You are sent on missions to prove you have what it takes. The game is played in a isometric view point looing down at your team.
               You are able to design each character with differnt skills and abilities both combat and non-comabt. The combat is tunr based the order based on characters speed.
               The games world is fantastic and the story is very well crafted.</p>
             <h6 class="top5">3: Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition</h6>
             <p>Original Sin was originally a pc only game but with Enhanced Edition it was brought to PS4 and XBox One. In the game you start as two source hunters going to investigate a murder,
               but this quickly gets more complicated. This game has many classic rpg features that rpg fans will love. Many side quests, multiple differnt characters to choose from to be your companions, varied loot,
               and well crafted NPCs. The game play is similar to Wasteland 2, each character has a certain number of action points to use on there turn to move attackand preform many other actions.
               The story is great and the character building is very remanisent of classic table-top rpgs. The game comes with 4 difficulties to choose from allowing people of any experience level to pcik it up and play.</p>
             <h6 class="top5">2: Fire Emblem: Fates</h6>
             <p>Fates is a game for the 3DS and came out in 3 parts. The original release safe two parts Conquest and Brithright. Fates overall is about the war between two Countries Nohr and Hoshido.
               in Conquest you play on the side of Nohr and in Birthright you play for Hoshido. In the game you use you character and the different characters you recruit to do battle on a grid based battle field.
               Each character can move and then take one action, like attacking or using an item. Later a third part was released, Revelation. In this mode you choose neither army and figt to bring peace between them.
               Each game has multiple difficulties but each one itself is a difficulty. Brithright being the easiest, and Conquest the hardest, with Revelations snug in the middle.</p>
             <h6 class="top5">1: Banner Saga 1 and 2</h6>
             <p>Beautiful! If I could only use one word to describe this game it would be beautiful. The art style is extemerly unique. It heps drive the mood and story. The gameplay is also very solid,
               this game also has a grid based system for your characters move around on. Of the five games this one definfitly has the least rpg elements when it comes to characters but it might have the best story.
               The characters are intriguing, The world is lush and the sweeping scenes inbetween battles helps propel the story and drive the players interest deeper. I would defintly suggest playing both and in order
               or else you're missing one of the games best features.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare</h3>
              <h5 class="author">Dylan Storing-O'Dowd 10/10/2016</h5>
            </header>
            <p> Many believe that the Call of Duty games are a waste of time and money and that each year they roll further down the hill. Infinite Warfare is a Diamond in the ruff but it certainly gives me hope that
              Call of Duty can climb back up the hill. The Story is short just like the other COD games that have been coming out. Infinite Warfare is the most futuristic COD to comeout so far, and i believe its gone
              far enough. This game has interesting elements like the space ship sections which allow the player to fly around in a two man fighter and combat other ships. These sections are fun and good break points
              inbetween the run and gun sections. The characters aren't themost original but I still found them delevoped well enough to become connected to the major ones. The story as a whole isn't a reason to go out
              and buy this game but it certinly is worth playing if you do pick up the game.</p>
            <img src="http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2016/07/CODIQ-1.jpg" alt="Call of Duty Infinite Warfare" id="COD">
            <p>Now the multiplayer, the real reason people keep buying the new COD each year. The gamplay is solid, not really original, but solid. It goes along the same lines as the past couple.
              It has characters to pick with different abilities like Black Ops 3 and has has the double jump and wall run like the past couple. There's a fair selection of guns and of course you can
              prestigue weapons and yourself. The game is fun for sure and would suggest to anyone looking for an multiplayer FPS to play.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Dark Cloud</h3>
              <h5 class="author">Dylan Storing-O'Dowd 9/25/2016</h5>
            </header>
            <p> Dark Cloud was originally an action RPG on the PS2 and has been ported to the PS4 digital shop. The only real changes I could find between the two versions is that the PS4 version has better
              graphics and has trophies to earn. The basic plot of the game you learn early on is that a Dark Genie has been summoned and has destoyed multiple towns around the world. Your characetr is choosen
              to put the world back together and stop the Genie. You will do this using the "Atlamillia" to find parts of the destroyed locations in dungeons and put them back where they belong. This gets into the
              building part of the game. After you find the parts you have to rebuild. This isn't an exact science becasue the player simply has a space where the town used to be so they can put the town back together
              in many different ways. The player can find NPCs that live in the towns and ask them how they think the town should be set up. If the player fullfills their requests by building the town in certain
              ways then the player is rewarded with items. Its really fun to rebuild the town and it allows breaks inbetween going into the dungeons so the player doesn't get bored of the gameplay.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AYUwv2dwUOU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Dark Cloud" id="DarkCloud">
            <p>The other part of the game is the dungeons. Each dungeon is split up into multiple floors. To advance to the next floor you have to find the key held by one of the monsters on the floor.
              To defeat monsters you obviously have to fight them. This is done in an action rpg based combat. The player moves around the monster blacking and attack when they need to. Depedning on which of the
              characters you are using the combat will be different. For example the main character uses a sword so combat will be up close and personal. Were the second characetr you get uses a slingshot and will
              fight from further away. As the enemies get harder characters have to become stronger. One of the games most interesting concepts comes in here, the characters dont level up their weapons do. When a
              monster is defeated it drops experince and this is absorbed into the weopon and when a weapons levels up its many stats increase. When a weapons stats are high enough it can be transformed into its next
              form and it becomes stronger. Upgrading weapons and seeing what they turn into is one of the best parts of this game. Over all, the gameplay is solid and between town buidling, going through dungeons,
              and making your weopons stronger this game has plenty of content to keep the player entertained.</p>
