          <p class="message">First off thank you for even clicking on the support tab and taking the time to read this. Briefly what you would be supporting is one part the
            growth of the website and one part starting up a youtube channel to go with the site. We here at college controllers love doing what we do, and we would like to do more.
             We understand that our readers are very busy people and often have to do many tasks at once. We believe making some of our content into video and audio format would make
              it much easier for people keep up with it. If you would like to support us monitarily you can go to our patreon account here patreon.com. Or if there is another
              way you think you could help us out send us an email at collegecontrollers@gmail.com. Thanks for reading our site, have a great day and Game On!</p>
